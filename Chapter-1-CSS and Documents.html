Elements in CSS 
====================-->

<!-- Elements are the basic building blocks of an HTML document. Each element (like p, div, span, img) contributes to the structure and visual presentation of the page. -->

Replaced vs Nonreplaced Elements 
==================================-->

<!-- 
- Replaced Elements
Elements whose content is replaced by external data, not written directly in HTML.
Examples: img, input
img displays an external image file
input is replaced by form controls like text fields or buttons

- Nonreplaced Elements
Elements whose content comes directly from the HTML and is rendered by the browser.
Examples: p, span, div, h1, ul
The browser displays their text or child elements inside the element’s box -->
