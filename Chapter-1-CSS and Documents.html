<!--=====================
Elements in CSS 
====================-->

<!-- Elements are the basic building blocks of an HTML document. Each element (like p, div, span, img) contributes to the structure and visual presentation of the page. -->

<!--============================== 
Replaced vs Nonreplaced Elements 
==================================-->

<!-- 
- Replaced Elements
Elements whose content is replaced by external data, not written directly in HTML.
Examples: img, input
img displays an external image file
input is replaced by form controls like text fields or buttons

- Nonreplaced Elements
Elements whose content comes directly from the HTML and is rendered by the browser.
Examples: p, span, div, h1, ul
The browser displays their text or child elements inside the element’s box -->

===================================
## Element Display Roles 
===================================

### Core Idea

CSS controls **how elements generate boxes and participate in layout** using the `display` property.
The two **fundamental display roles** are **block-level** and **inline-level**. All other display values are built on top of these.

---

## Block-Level Elements

* Generate a box that **starts on a new line**
* **Fill the available width** of the parent by default
* Create visual breaks before and after
* Common examples: `div`, `p`, `section`
* `list-item` is a special block type that also generates a **marker** (bullet/number)

---

## Inline-Level Elements

* Generate boxes **within a line of text**
* **Do not break** the line flow
* Width depends on content
* Common examples: `span`, `a`, `em`, `strong`

---

## HTML vs CSS Nesting Rules

* **HTML rule:** Block elements cannot be nested inside inline elements
* **CSS rule:** Display roles can be freely changed and nested

```css
p { display: inline; }
em { display: block; }
```

✔ Valid in CSS
❌ Still invalid if HTML structure itself is illegal

---

## The `display` Property (Overview)

```css
display: <display-outside> <display-inside>;
```

### Default

* Initial value: `inline`
* Applies to: all elements
* Animatable:  No

---

## Display Value Categories

###  `<display-outside>` — How the element behaves in layout

* `block`
* `inline`
* `run-in` (rare / limited support)

---

###  `<display-inside>` — How children are laid out

* `flow` (normal document flow)
* `flow-root` (new block formatting context)
* `flex`
* `grid`
* `table`
* `ruby`

---

###  `<display-listitem>`

* `list-item`
* Behaves like a block + marker (used by `li`)

---

###  `<display-internal>` (table & ruby internals)

* `table-row-group`
* `table-header-group`
* `table-footer-group`
* `table-row`
* `table-cell`
* `table-column-group`
* `table-column`
* `table-caption`
* `ruby-base`, `ruby-text`, etc.

(Used internally by browsers, not commonly authored)

---

###  `<display-box>`

* `none` → element removed from layout
* `contents` → element disappears, children remain

---

###  `<display-legacy>` (combined forms)

* `inline-block`
* `inline-table`
* `inline-flex`
* `inline-grid`
* `inline-list-item`

(Older syntax combining outside + inside roles)

---

## Why Display Roles Matter

* CSS can **override default HTML behavior**
* Essential for **layout systems** (Flexbox, Grid)
* Critical for **XML documents**, which have no built-in display semantics

---

## Key Takeaway

> **HTML defines structure.
> CSS defines layout behavior.
> `display` is the bridge between them.

 =======================================
 Bringing CSS and HTML Together 
 =======================================

HTML provides structure and meaning, not visual design.

CSS controls presentation, without changing document structure.

Older web pages often mixed structure and visuals, which caused poor semantics.

CSS works because HTML has an inherent structure.

CSS can be applied to HTML in multiple ways:

External stylesheet (<link>)

Internal stylesheet (<style>)

Imported stylesheet (@import)

Inline styles (style attribute)

This separation allows clean, maintainable, and reusable designs.

Key idea:

HTML = what the content is
CSS = how the content looks -->


<!-- 
======================
The <link> Tag 
======================

The <link> tag is used to connect an external CSS file to an HTML document.

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sheet1.css" media="all">

External stylesheets are separate .css files, not embedded in HTML.
<link> must be placed inside <head>, never inside <body>.
The browser loads the CSS file and applies its rules to the HTML document.
External stylesheets contain only CSS rules and CSS comments — no HTML markup.
CSS files are usually saved with a .css extension.
Using .css is recommended because:
Some browsers require it
Some servers won’t serve CSS correctly without it
@import can load additional stylesheets but must appear at the top of a CSS file.

Key benefit:
External stylesheets keep structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) cleanly separated. -->

<!--
=======================
 Attributes 
=======================

- rel="stylesheet"
Defines the relationship between HTML and the linked file
Tells the browser the file is a stylesheet

- type="text/css"
Specifies the content type of the linked file
Helps the browser identify the stylesheet language
Recommended for compatibility, even if optional in modern HTML

- href
URL of the external CSS file
Can be relative or absolute

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://example.com/style.css">


- media
Specifies where the stylesheet should apply
Accepts one or more media types, separated by commas

<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="visual.css" media="screen, projection">


- Multiple stylesheets
Browsers load all linked stylesheets
CSS rules from all files are combined

<link rel="stylesheet" href="basic.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="theme.css">


- title attribute
Optional and rarely used
Can affect alternate stylesheets if misused
Important for advanced stylesheet switching


Key takeaway:
The <link> tag connects HTML to external CSS and controls what, how, and where styles are applied. -->


<!--
===============================
 Alternate Stylesheets
================================

HTML allows authors to define alternate stylesheets, which users can choose to change the presentation of a document. Alternate stylesheets are declared using 
the rel="alternate stylesheet" attribute and are applied only when selected by the user.

Browsers that support alternate stylesheets use the title attribute of the <link> element to present a list of available styles. The stylesheet with rel="stylesheet"
 and a title is treated as the preferred stylesheet and is applied by default. When an alternate stylesheet is selected, the preferred stylesheet is disabled.

Stylesheets can also be grouped across media types (such as screen and print) by giving them the same title, allowing consistent presentation choices.

If a stylesheet has no title, it becomes a persistent stylesheet and is always applied.

Example
Preferred stylesheet
<link rel="stylesheet" href="default.css" title="Default" media="screen">

Alternate stylesheets
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="bigtext.css" title="Big Text" media="screen">
<link rel="alternate stylesheet" href="colors.css" title="High Contrast" media="screen">

Persistent stylesheet (always applied)
<link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css">


In this example, default.css is used initially, bigtext.css or colors.css can be selected by the user, and base.css is always applied regardless of the 
selected style. -->


<!--
========================
 style Element
 ========================

The style element is used to include CSS directly within an HTML document. It is placed inside the <head> section and must include the attribute 
    type="text/css" when defining CSS rules.

<style type="text/css">
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }
</style>


The CSS rules written between the opening <style> and closing </style> tags form the document (or embedded) stylesheet. These styles apply only to the 
document in which they appear.

The style element can also include a media attribute to control when the styles are applied (such as screen or print), and it may use the @import directive 
to load external stylesheets. -->

<!-- 
=================================
@import Directive
=================================
The @import directive is used inside a <style> element or an external stylesheet to load and apply external CSS files. It performs a function similar to the <link> tag but differs in syntax and placement.

The @import statement must appear before all other CSS rules in a stylesheet; otherwise, it will be ignored by the browser. Multiple @import directives can be used, and all imported stylesheets are loaded and applied—there is no support for alternate stylesheets.

Media types can also be specified to control when an imported stylesheet is applied.

@import url("styles.css") screen;
@import url("print.css") print;

body {
  color: black;
}


The @import directive is especially useful in external stylesheets, where the <link> element cannot be used.

Relative and Absolute URLs

Relative URL
Specifies a path relative to the current file’s location.

@import url("basic-text.css");


Absolute URL
Specifies the full address, including the protocol and domain name.

@import url("https://example.org/library/layout.css");


Relative URLs are shorter and commonly used within the same project, while absolute URLs are useful when referencing stylesheets hosted on external servers. -->
